So how I manage to deploy this blog in my local host? I used these two articles

- [Start a Blog in 2019 with Gatsby.js and Netlify](https://daveceddia.com/start-blog-gatsby-netlify/)

As usual I run into some trouble, this time was EACCES and this Stack Overflow post helped me resolve the problem
- [Error: EACCES: permission denied, access '/usr/lib/node_modules'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46058546/error-eacces-permission-denied-access-usr-lib-node-modules)
