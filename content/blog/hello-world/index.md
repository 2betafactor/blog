Today's featured picture in Wikipedia: [The mystical Nativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystical_Nativity).

>The Mystical Nativity is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, dated around 1500 to 1501. It is his only signed work and has unusual iconography for a painting of the Nativity. The Virgin Mary is shown kneeling before the Christ Child in the centre, in the presence of the shepherds and wise men who are visiting him. At the bottom of the work, three angels embrace three men, seeming to raise them up from the ground, while seven devils behind them flee to the underworld.
